<h1>Testing Project for **www.magazinulapicultorului.ro**</h1>

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application

Application under test: www.magazinulapicultorului.ro

Tools used: Jira, Zephyr Squad.

<h2>Functional specifications:</h2>

The below stories (GMT-44 Comparare produse, GMT-45 Elemente din partea inferioara a paginii, GMT-62 Conectare utilizator cu e-mail si parola) were created in Jira and describes the functional specifications of these modules, for which the final project is performed upon.

<h2>Testing process</h2>

The test process was performed based on the standard test process as described below.

<h3>1.1 Test planning</h3>

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the following modules from the www.magazinulapicultorului.ro application:

<li>Comparare produse</li>
<li>Elemente din partea inferioara a paginii</li>
<li>Conectare utilizator cu e-mail si parola</li>
<br>The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.

<h3>1.4 Test Design</h3>

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad based on the analysis of the specifications. The test cases can be accessed here 
https://github.com/gabrielmirea/Proiect-Final-Testare-Manuala/blob/main/ZFJ-issue-export-08-11-2024-60b8da7ffffe297-0001.xlsx

<h3>1.5 Test Implementation</h3>

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

<li> Smoke test has been passed </li>
<li> The test environment is ready </li>
<li> The test data is ready</li>

<h3>1.6. Test Execution </h3>

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: Magazin apicol

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: (https://github.com/gabrielmirea/Proiect-Final-Testare-Manuala/blob/main/Bugs%20report.doc)

The following is a summary of the bugs that have been found
**(inserati o lista cu titlurile bug-urilor identificate impreuna cu prioritatea si severitatea fiecaruia)**

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.

<h3> 1.7 Test Completion</h3>
As the Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team

The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: **(inserati aici fie o poza cu matricea de trasabilitate din jira, fie linkul catre fiserul excel exportat din jira cu matricea de trasabilitate. Nu uitati sa faceti filtrare dupa type = story)**

Test execution chart was generated and can be found below. 

**(inserati aici raportul de executie generat din jira din sectiunea de dashboards)**

The final report shows that a number **(inserati numarul de teste)** tests have failed of a total of **(inserati numarul de teste)**

A number of **(inserati numarul de bug-uri)** total bugs were found, from which the priority is: **(inserati numarul de bug-uri)** are high and **(inserati numarul de bug-uri)** are medium.

**(inserati aici o concluzie generala a testarii care sa cuprinda cate teste au fost create si executate, ce procentaj aproximativ din cerintele in scop au fost acoperite, daca exista vreo functionalitate pe care nu ai apucat sa o testezi, daca bug-urile gasite impacteaza lansarea produsului in productie sau se pot fixa si ulterior, daca ai identificat riscuri de produs care trebuie mitigate, daca e vreo reecomandare pe care vrei sa o faci pentru lansare, daca sunt ceva lessons learned de care trebuie sa se tina cont la proiectele viitoare etc.)**
